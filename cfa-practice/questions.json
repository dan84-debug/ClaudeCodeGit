To offset, he must SELL EUR forward → use BID side.\nSpot bid: 1.1352, Forward points bid: −14\n\nStep 2: All-in forward rate = 1.1352 + (−14/10,000) = 1.1352 − 0.0014 = 1.1338 USD/EUR\n\nStep 3: Cash flow at settlement:\nOriginal: BUY EUR 20M at 1.1308 → Pay USD 22,616,000\nOffset: SELL EUR 20M at 1.1338 → Receive USD 22,676,000\nNet = USD 22,676,000 − USD 22,616,000 = USD 60,000\n\nStep 4: Discount at USD rate for 90 days:\nPV = 60,000 / [1 + 0.0053 × (90/360)] = 60,000 / 1.001325 = USD 59,921\n\nChoice C (115,847): Added forward points instead of subtracting (treated negative as positive): 1.1352 + 0.0014 = 1.1366\nChoice B (69,907): Used OFFER rate instead of BID: 1.1355 − 0.0012 = 1.1343",

      "question": "Nathan Moffet is a fixed-income portfolio manager analyzing credit risk within a corporate bond portfolio. Company B plans to issue a covered bond.\n\nA covered bond is a senior debt obligation of a financial institution that gives recourse to both the originator/issuer and a predetermined underlying collateral pool (the 'cover pool').

This benefits the issuer through lower borrowing costs and a wider investor base.\n\nChoice B is wrong: The covered bond is an ONGOING obligation. Dual recourse means the issuer NEVER escapes liability — they must make payments even if the cover pool falls short.\nChoice C is wrong: The cover pool is DYNAMIC, not static.
