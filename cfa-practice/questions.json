Plum has adopted the Standards as part of its ethics and compliance policy.\n\nPark receives orders from four of her clients to purchase shares in an oversubscribed IPO. She determines that the IPO is suitable for all of these clients. One of the clients, a family member of Park's, has a regular fee-paying account that is managed similarly to those of the other three clients. Park allocates the shares she receives to the four clients on a pro rata basis according to order size.

Club convergence theory says only countries with the right institutions can converge, and poor countries can join if they make necessary institutional changes.\n\nWhy C (Conditional) is Wrong:\nConditional convergence says countries converge to their own steady state based on savings rate, population growth rate, and production function. Country A has higher population growth than developed economies, so under conditional convergence, it would converge to a different (lower) steady state, not match developed country income levels.\n\nWhy B (Absolute) is Wrong:\nAbsolute convergence assumes all countries automatically converge regardless of characteristics.
