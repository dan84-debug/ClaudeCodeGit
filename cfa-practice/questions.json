      "question": "Irina Benoit, CFA, starts her own firm (BCT) and writes a compliance manual with three procedures:\n\nProcedure 1: Analysts may accept gifts in the form of business-related entertainment to a maximum value listed by the compliance office.\n\nProcedure 2: For all analysts, the purchase of a company's stock through a private placement is capped at a maximum per private placement as listed by the compliance office.\n\nProcedure 3: When attending meetings at an issuer's headquarters, analysts are allowed to accept modest commercial transportation and hotel accommodation paid by the issuer.\n\nWhich procedure in the BCT compliance manual is NOT consistent with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct?",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Procedure 3 violates Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity.\n\nThe recommended procedures for Standard I(B) explicitly state: When attending meetings at an issuer's headquarters, members and candidates should PAY FOR their own commercial transportation and hotel charges. No corporate issuer should reimburse members or candidates for air transportation.\n\nAllowing issuers to pay for transportation and hotels creates a conflict of interest that compromises the analyst's independence and objectivity.\n\nProcedure 1 is CONSISTENT: Standard I(B) permits customary, ordinary business-related entertainment as long as it doesn't influence or reward analysts. Setting a maximum value is a recommended practice.\n\nProcedure 2 is CONSISTENT: Standard I(B) recommends formal policies with strict limits on employee purchases through private placements. Capping purchases is appropriate.",
