## Equity Valuation

### Q1 — FCFE vs Residual Income Model Selection

**Full Vignette Context:**
Hector Priam, an equity analyst at Troy Investments, is considering the following three valuation models.

- Model 1: Dividend discount model
- Model 2: Residual income model
- Model 3: Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model

Priam assumes constant growth in earnings and collects the information on Castor Industries shown in Exhibit 1.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Expected EPS next period (E₁) | $2.65 |
| Present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) per share | $16.52 |
| Required return on equity | 12% |
| Dividend payout ratio (constant) | 40% |
| Return on assets (ROA) | 9% |
| Current book value per share (B₀) | $17.25 |
| Total assets (millions) | $77 |
| Shareholders' equity (millions) | $45 |

**Question:**
Which of the following is the best reason to use Model 3 (FCFE) rather than Model 2 (Residual Income) to value a company?

A. The investor takes a control perspective
B. The company's residual net income is negative
C. The company's expected free cash flow is negative

**Your Answer:** B (The company's residual net income is negative)

**Correct Answer:** A (The investor takes a control perspective)

**Full Explanation:**

**When to Use FCFE vs Residual Income:**

| Situation | Preferred Model |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Control perspective** | **FCFE** — can redeploy cash outside company |
| Negative free cash flow | Residual Income — works when FCF is negative |
| No dividends | Either FCFE or RI |
| Going concern focus | Residual Income |

**Why A is Correct:**
FCFE represents cash flow that can be redeployed outside the company without affecting capital investments. A controlling equity interest can bring about such redeployment. FCFE valuation is appropriate for investors who want to take a **control perspective**.

Residual income valuation does NOT indicate how much free cash is available for outside deployment.

**Why B is Wrong:**
Negative residual income is NOT a reason to prefer FCFE over RI. The residual income model can value a firm even if residual income is negative:
- Positive RI → Company is creating value
- Negative RI → Company is destroying value
- Either way, the model works

**Why C is Wrong:**
Negative free cash flow is actually a reason to prefer **Residual Income OVER FCFE**, not the reverse. RI is suitable when:
- Company is not paying dividends
- Expected free cash flows are negative within the forecast horizon

**Key Principle:**
> FCFE = Control perspective (redeploy cash)
> RI = Going concern, negative FCF situations

## Corporate Issuers

### Q7 — Comparable Transaction Method

**Full Vignette Context:**
Palmco Plc is a large British drinks manufacturer. Palmco's CEO, Jacky Westerholm, approaches CFO Fabio Sylvester with a proposal that Palmco acquire Spritz Ltd. Spritz is a privately held drinks company that specializes in alcoholic seltzers.

To provide a quick estimate of the price that Palmco should expect to pay to acquire Spritz, Sylvester gathers information about two comparable transactions, both of which completed in the last two years. Exhibit 1 shows the transaction price per share for each comparable company, along with various per share metrics which are given equal weights in Sylvester's analysis.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Metric | Company 1 | Company 2 | Spritz |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Transaction share price (£) | 10.55 | 35.60 | ? |
| Earnings per share (£) | 0.52 | 1.36 | 3.24 |
| Book value per share (£) | 3.15 | 10.05 | 15.62 |

**Question:**
Using Sylvester's comparable transaction method, the estimated share price at which Spritz can be acquired is closest to:

A. £56.53
B. £64.55
C. £67.07

**Your Answer:** C (£67.07)

**Correct Answer:** B (£64.55)

**Full Explanation:**

**Correct Method: Calculate multiples for EACH company, THEN average**

**Step 1: Calculate P/E Ratios for Each Company**
> Company 1 P/E = £10.55 / £0.52 = 20.29
> Company 2 P/E = £35.60 / £1.36 = 26.18
> Average P/E = (20.29 + 26.18) / 2 = **23.23**

**Step 2: Calculate P/BV Ratios for Each Company**
> Company 1 P/BV = £10.55 / £3.15 = 3.35
> Company 2 P/BV = £35.60 / £10.05 = 3.54
> Average P/BV = (3.35 + 3.54) / 2 = **3.45**

**Step 3: Apply Multiples to Spritz**
> Spritz value from P/E = 23.23 × £3.24 = **£75.27**
> Spritz value from P/BV = 3.45 × £15.62 = **£53.82**

**Step 4: Average the Values (Equal Weights)**
> Spritz estimated price = (£75.27 + £53.82) / 2 = **£64.55**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer C = £67.07):**
You averaged the metrics BEFORE calculating the ratios:

Wrong method:
> Average transaction price = (£10.55 + £35.60) / 2 = £23.075
> Average EPS = (£0.52 + £1.36) / 2 = £0.94
> Average BV = (£3.15 + £10.05) / 2 = £6.60
> Wrong P/E = £23.075 / £0.94 = 24.55
> Wrong P/BV = £23.075 / £6.60 = 3.50
> Wrong Spritz P/E value = 24.55 × £3.24 = £79.54
> Wrong Spritz P/BV value = 3.50 × £15.62 = £54.61
> Wrong average = (£79.54 + £54.61) / 2 = **£67.07**

**Key Rule:**
> Calculate multiples FIRST for each comparable, THEN average the multiples, THEN apply to target.

### Q8 — Post-Acquisition Capital Structure

**Full Vignette Context:**
Palmco's board of directors and Westerholm agree that the acquisition is the right move to improve stakeholder value and so they decide to make an offer to purchase Spritz. Currently, Palmco has no preferred equity and 25 million common equity shares outstanding, each trading at £28.00 per share. Palmco also has a book value of debt of £850 million, including publicly traded debt without any embedded options. Details of Palmco's offer are summarized in Exhibit 2. The balance of financing for the transaction will be funded with cash on hand.

**Exhibit 2:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Offer price per Spritz share | £70.00 |
| Mix of consideration per Spritz share | 1 Palmco share and £42.00 cash |
| Total consideration | £350 million |
| Assumed Spritz debt | £150 million |
| New borrowings by Palmco | £200 million |
| Share issuance | 5 million Palmco shares |

**Question:**
Palmco's capital structure after acquiring Spritz is closest to:

A. 54.8% debt and 45.2% equity
B. 55.6% debt and 44.4% equity
C. 58.8% debt and 41.2% equity

**Your Answer:** B (55.6% debt and 44.4% equity)

**Correct Answer:** C (58.8% debt and 41.2% equity)

**Full Explanation:**

**Step 1: Calculate Post-Acquisition Debt**

| Debt Component | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Existing Palmco debt | £850 million |
| + Assumed Spritz debt | £150 million |
| + New borrowings | £200 million |
| **Total Post-Acquisition Debt** | **£1,200 million** |

**Step 2: Calculate Post-Acquisition Equity (Market Value)**

| Equity Component | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Existing shares | 25 million |
| + New shares issued | 5 million |
| **Total shares** | **30 million** |
| × Share price | £28.00 |
| **Total Post-Acquisition Equity** | **£840 million** |

**Step 3: Calculate Capital Structure**

> Total Capital = £1,200M + £840M = **£2,040 million**
> Debt % = £1,200M / £2,040M = **58.8%**
> Equity % = £840M / £2,040M = **41.2%**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer B = 55.6% / 44.4%):**
You forgot to include the **assumed Spritz debt** (£150 million):

Wrong calculation:
> Debt = £850M + £200M = £1,050M (missing £150M Spritz debt)
> Total = £1,050M + £840M = £1,890M
> Wrong Debt % = £1,050M / £1,890M = 55.6%

**Key Point:**
When calculating post-acquisition capital structure, include ALL debt:
1. Acquirer's existing debt
2. **Target's assumed debt** (often forgotten!)
3. New debt issued for the acquisition

## Financial Statement Analysis

### Q9 — Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

**Full Vignette Context:**
Janice McCabe is an analyst specializing in the financial institutions sector. She is currently reviewing the financial statements and regulatory disclosures for Acme Bank, a large commercial bank headquartered in the US. Acme prepares its financial statements in accordance with US GAAP.

As part of her analysis, McCabe uses the CAMELS approach. She reviews Acme's selected financial information (in $ millions) for the most recent year in Exhibit 1 and computes its Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Item | Value ($ millions) |
|------|-------------------|
| Common stockholders' equity | 176,400 |
| Intangible assets | 18,784 |
| Deferred tax assets | 7,986 |
| Total risk-weighted assets | 1,042,361 |
| Total assets | 1,596,723 |

**Question:**
Acme's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio for the most recent year is closest to:

A. 9%
B. 14%
C. 17%

**Your Answer:** C (17%)

**Correct Answer:** B (14%)

**Full Explanation:**

**CET1 Capital Ratio Formula:**
> CET1 Ratio = (Common Equity − Intangibles − Deferred Tax Assets) / Risk-Weighted Assets

**Calculation:**
> CET1 Capital = $176,400M − $18,784M − $7,986M = **$149,630 million**
> CET1 Ratio = $149,630M / $1,042,361M = **14.35% ≈ 14%**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer C = 17%):**
You did NOT deduct intangible assets and deferred tax assets:

Wrong calculation:
> Wrong CET1 = $176,400M / $1,042,361M = 16.9% ≈ 17%

**Why A is Wrong (9%):**
Answer A uses TOTAL assets instead of RISK-WEIGHTED assets:
> Wrong: ($176,400M − $18,784M − $7,986M) / $1,596,723M = 9.4%

**CET1 Capital Components:**

| Included | Deducted |
|----------|----------|
| Common stock | Intangible assets |
| Retained earnings | Deferred tax assets |
| AOCI | Goodwill |
| Issuance surplus | |

**Key Formula:**
> CET1 Ratio = (CET1 Capital − Regulatory Deductions) / Risk-Weighted Assets

### Q11 — Stock-Based Compensation Tax Effects (US GAAP)

**Full Vignette Context:**
McCabe notes that a large restricted stock grant of Acme vested during the current year, and that Acme's share price increased significantly between the initial stock grant date and the settlement date. Recognizing that Acme's financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, McCabe considers how the change in share price between the initial grant date and the settlement date will affect Acme's net income in the current year.

**Question:**
The change in Acme's share price between the initial grant date and the settlement date will most likely cause its current-year net income to:

A. Decrease
B. Not change
C. Increase

**Your Answer:** B (Not change)

**Correct Answer:** C (Increase)

**Full Explanation:**

**Tax Treatment of Stock-Based Compensation:**

| Item | Book Treatment | Tax Treatment |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Expense basis | Grant-date fair value | Settlement/exercise-date intrinsic value |
| Timing | Over vesting period | At settlement |

**When Share Price INCREASES (Grant to Settlement):**
- Tax deduction > Cumulative book expense
- This creates an **EXCESS TAX BENEFIT** (tax windfall)
- Under **US GAAP**: Excess tax benefit → **DECREASES income tax expense** → **INCREASES net income**

**When Share Price DECREASES:**
- Tax deduction < Cumulative book expense
- This creates a **TAX SHORTFALL**
- Under US GAAP: Tax shortfall → INCREASES income tax expense → DECREASES net income

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
You may have confused US GAAP with IFRS treatment:

| Standard | Where Windfall/Shortfall Goes |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **US GAAP** | **Income Statement** (affects net income) |
| IFRS | Equity (does NOT affect net income) |

**Key Principle:**
> Under US GAAP, stock price increase at settlement → Tax windfall → Lower tax expense → Higher net income

### Q37 — Bond Classification and Income Statement Impact

**Full Vignette Context:**
Marcos Bonetti is an equity analyst reviewing the financial statements of Cela SpA, a publicly traded Italian company that reports under IFRS.

Bonetti notes that Cela invested €25 million in each of three bonds at the beginning of the most recent year. All three bonds were acquired at par and paid their annual coupons at the end of the most recent year. Bonetti compiles information about these bonds in Exhibit 1.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Item | Bond 1 | Bond 2 | Bond 3 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Classification | Amortized cost | FVOCI | FVPL |
| Fair value at end of year | €24,990,000 | €25,600,000 | €24,700,000 |
| Coupon interest rate | 6.0% | 5.5% | 7.0% |

**Question:**
Which bond had the largest contribution to Cela's pre-tax income in the most recent year?

A. Bond 1
B. Bond 2
C. Bond 3

**Your Answer:** C (Bond 3)

**Correct Answer:** A (Bond 1)

**Full Explanation:**

**Income Recognition by Classification:**

| Classification | Interest Income | FV Change | Goes to P&L? |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Amortized Cost** | Yes (coupon) | No recognition | Interest only |
| **FVOCI** | Yes (coupon) | Yes, but to **OCI** | Interest only to P&L |
| **FVPL** | Yes (coupon) | Yes, to **P&L** | Both to P&L |

**Bond 1 (Amortized Cost):**
> P&L contribution = Coupon only
> = 6.0% × €25,000,000 = **€1,500,000**

**Bond 2 (FVOCI):**
> P&L contribution = Coupon only (FV change goes to OCI)
> = 5.5% × €25,000,000 = **€1,375,000**

**Bond 3 (FVPL):**
> Coupon = 7.0% × €25,000,000 = €1,750,000
> FV change = €24,700,000 − €25,000,000 = **−€300,000**
> P&L contribution = €1,750,000 − €300,000 = **€1,450,000**

**Ranking:**
1. **Bond 1: €1,500,000** ← HIGHEST
2. Bond 3: €1,450,000
3. Bond 2: €1,375,000

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
You likely focused on the highest coupon rate (Bond 3 at 7%) without accounting for the fair value LOSS that also hits P&L for FVPL securities.

**Key Insight:**
> For FVPL, both gains AND losses flow through P&L. A high coupon can be offset by FV decline.

## Fixed Income

### Q14 — Forward Contract Value and Rate Expectations

**Full Vignette Context:**
Alice Walhan, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Wye Creek Investments, is evaluating her portfolio and reviewing new investment opportunities in three different countries. For her analysis, Walhan collects the par and spot rates for various maturities of government bonds of Country A, as shown in Exhibit 1.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Maturity (Years) | Par Rate | Spot Rate |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 3.25% | 3.25% |
| 2 | 3.00% | 3.00% |
| 3 | 2.75% | 2.80% |

Walhan decides to enter into a 2-year forward contract to purchase a 2-year zero-coupon government bond. Wye Creek's economist expects increasing employment and lower inflation in Country A to drive future spot rates **below** those predicted by the prevailing forward rates.

**Question:**
If the expectation of Wye Creek's economist is correct, the price of Walhan's forward contract would most likely:

A. Decrease
B. Remain unchanged
C. Increase

**Your Answer:** A (Decrease)

**Correct Answer:** C (Increase)

**Full Explanation:**

**Forward Contract Value Dynamics:**

The forward contract is to BUY a bond. Walhan is LONG the forward.

**Relationship between spot rates and bond prices:**
- Lower spot rates → Higher bond prices
- Higher spot rates → Lower bond prices

**If future spot rates are BELOW forward-implied rates:**
- Actual future bond price will be HIGHER than forward-implied price
- Walhan locked in a purchase price based on forward rates
- She will be buying at a better (lower) price than the actual market price
- The forward contract VALUE INCREASES

**Think of it this way:**
- Forward price was set assuming rates would follow the forward curve
- If actual rates are LOWER than expected, the bond is worth MORE
- Long position in forward benefits → Forward value INCREASES

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
You may have confused the direction. Lower rates = higher bond prices = GAIN for long forward position.

**Key Rule:**
| Rate Expectation vs Forward | Long Forward Value |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Future spot < Forward implied | **Increases** (buy bond worth more) |
| Future spot > Forward implied | Decreases (buy bond worth less) |
| Future spot = Forward implied | Unchanged |

### Q34 — Effective Convexity Calculation

**Full Vignette Context:**
Grant Pulo is a fixed income analyst evaluating bonds for his firm's portfolio.

Pulo gathers information about a callable bond and a putable bond issued by Corr, as shown in Exhibit 2.

**Exhibit 2:**
| Item | Callable Bond | Putable Bond |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Maturity | 3 years | 3 years |
| Par value | $100 | $100 |
| Current price (PV₀) | $102.91 | $104.58 |
| Price when curve shifts UP 50 bps (PV₊) | $102.03 | $103.45 |
| Price when curve shifts DOWN 50 bps (PV₋) | $103.41 | $105.96 |

Pulo calculates the effective convexity of the Corr putable bond.

**Question:**
The effective convexity of the Corr putable bond is closest to:

A. 2.40
B. 95.62
C. 100.00

**Your Answer:** A (2.40)

**Correct Answer:** B (95.62)

**Full Explanation:**

**Effective Convexity Formula:**
> Effective Convexity = [PV₋ + PV₊ − (2 × PV₀)] / [(ΔCurve)² × PV₀]

**Step 1: Identify Values for Putable Bond**
- PV₋ = $105.96 (price when rates fall)
- PV₊ = $103.45 (price when rates rise)
- PV₀ = $104.58 (current price)
- ΔCurve = 0.005 (50 bps = 0.50% = 0.005)

**Step 2: Calculate Numerator**
> Numerator = PV₋ + PV₊ − (2 × PV₀)
> Numerator = $105.96 + $103.45 − (2 × $104.58)
> Numerator = $209.41 − $209.16
> Numerator = **$0.25**

**Step 3: Calculate Denominator**
> Denominator = (ΔCurve)² × PV₀
> Denominator = (0.005)² × $104.58
> Denominator = 0.000025 × $104.58
> Denominator = **$0.0026145**

**Step 4: Calculate Effective Convexity**
> Effective Convexity = $0.25 / $0.0026145
> Effective Convexity = **95.62**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer A = 2.40):**
You calculated **EFFECTIVE DURATION** instead of convexity:

Effective Duration Formula:
> Duration = (PV₋ − PV₊) / [2 × ΔCurve × PV₀]
> Duration = ($105.96 − $103.45) / [2 × 0.005 × $104.58]
> Duration = $2.51 / $1.0458
> Duration = **2.40** ← This is duration, NOT convexity!

**Key Distinction:**

| Measure | Formula | Numerator |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Duration** | (PV₋ − PV₊) / [2 × Δ × PV₀] | Difference of prices |
| **Convexity** | [PV₋ + PV₊ − 2PV₀] / [Δ² × PV₀] | **Sum** minus 2× current |

**Memory Aid:**
- Duration: **Difference** in numerator, **linear** Δ in denominator
- Convexity: **Sum minus 2×current** in numerator, **squared** Δ in denominator

## Portfolio Management

### Q17 — Return from Security Selection (Factor Model)

**Full Vignette Context:**
Anna Kemp is an analyst with a UK-based asset management firm. Kemp uses macroeconomic factor models to analyze the returns of both UK equity portfolios.

For Portfolio 1, Kemp's model uses the inflation rate and the GDP growth rate as its factors. The portfolio's benchmark is a major UK equity market index, and the portfolio's active return for the most recent year was 1.34%. Based on the information in Exhibit 1, Kemp determines the contribution of factor tilts and security selection to the portfolio's active return.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Factor | Portfolio 1 Sensitivity | Benchmark Sensitivity | Factor Surprise |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Inflation rate | −1.5 | −2.1 | 0.4% |
| GDP growth rate | 2.4 | 0.7 | −0.8% |

**Question:**
For the most recent year, the return from security selection for Portfolio 1 was closest to:

A. 0.22%
B. 1.74%
C. 2.46%

**Your Answer:** A (0.22%)

**Correct Answer:** C (2.46%)

**Full Explanation:**

**Active Return Decomposition:**
> Active Return = Return from Factor Tilts + Return from Security Selection

**Factor Tilt Return Formula:**
> Factor Tilt Return = Σ [(Portfolio Sensitivity − Benchmark Sensitivity) × Factor Surprise]

**Step 1: Calculate Factor Tilt Return**

**Inflation Factor:**
> = (−1.5 − (−2.1)) × 0.4%
> = (−1.5 + 2.1) × 0.4%
> = 0.6 × 0.4%
> = **+0.24%**

**GDP Growth Factor:**
> = (2.4 − 0.7) × (−0.8%)
> = 1.7 × (−0.8%)
> = **−1.36%**

**Total Factor Tilt Return:**
> = 0.24% + (−1.36%)
> = **−1.12%**

**Step 2: Calculate Security Selection Return**
> Security Selection = Active Return − Factor Tilt Return
> Security Selection = 1.34% − (−1.12%)
> Security Selection = 1.34% + 1.12%
> Security Selection = **2.46%**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer A = 0.22%):**
You REVERSED the order in the factor tilt formula:

Wrong formula: (Benchmark − Portfolio) instead of (Portfolio − Benchmark)
> Wrong Inflation = (−2.1 − (−1.5)) × 0.4% = −0.6 × 0.4% = −0.24%
> Wrong GDP = (0.7 − 2.4) × (−0.8%) = −1.7 × (−0.8%) = +1.36%
> Wrong Factor Tilt = −0.24% + 1.36% = +1.12%
> Wrong Security Selection = 1.34% − 1.12% = 0.22%

**Key Formula:**
> Factor Tilt = Σ [(Portfolio_sensitivity − Benchmark_sensitivity) × Factor_return]

**Remember:** Portfolio MINUS Benchmark (alphabetical order: B comes before P, but subtract B FROM P)

### Q19 — ETF Holding Period Cost

**Full Vignette Context:**
Kemp calculates the expected total holding period cost of investing in a US equity ETF, based on the following information:

- The ETF will be held for **six months**
- The one-way commission is 0.05%
- The bid–ask spread on purchase and sale is 0.20%
- The **annual** management fee is 0.30%

**Question:**
The expected total holding period cost of investing in the US equity ETF is closest to:

A. 0.45%
B. 0.60%
C. 0.65%

**Your Answer:** B (0.60%)

**Correct Answer:** A (0.45%)

**Full Explanation:**

**ETF Holding Period Cost Components:**

| Component | Calculation | Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Management fee (6 months) | 0.30% × (6/12) | 0.15% |
| Round-trip commission | 0.05% × 2 | 0.10% |
| Bid-ask spread | 0.20% × 1 | 0.20% |
| **Total** | | **0.45%** |

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer B = 0.60%):**
You used the ANNUAL management fee instead of pro-rating for 6 months:

Wrong calculation:
> 0.30% (full annual fee) + 0.10% (commission) + 0.20% (spread) = 0.60%

**Why C is Wrong (0.65%):**
Answer C doubles the bid-ask spread:
> 0.15% + 0.10% + (0.20% × 2) = 0.65%

**Key Points:**
1. **Management fee:** Pro-rate for holding period (÷12 × months)
2. **Commission:** Pay TWICE (buy and sell) = round-trip
3. **Bid-ask spread:** Pay ONCE (built into buy at ask, sell at bid)

**Memory Aid:**
> Commission = 2× (round trip)
> Spread = 1× (once on round trip)
> Fee = Annualized × (holding period/12)

### Q24 — Data Snooping Bias in Backtesting

**Full Vignette Context:**
Chenta plans to launch a new portfolio for clients utilizing an equity investment strategy based on a multifactor model. To select the new investment strategy, Pirlo identifies ten fundamental factors and uses these factors to backtest numerous strategies. For the backtest, Pirlo uses point-in-time data while accounting for reporting lags and data revisions. Based on the backtesting results, Pirlo selects the strategy with the highest t-statistics for Chenta's new portfolio offering.

**Question:**
The backtesting approach used to identify the new investment strategy is most likely subject to which of the following biases?

A. Data snooping
B. Look-ahead bias
C. Survivorship bias

**Your Answer:** C (Survivorship bias)

**Correct Answer:** A (Data snooping)

**Full Explanation:**

**Types of Backtesting Bias:**

| Bias | Definition | How to Avoid |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Data Snooping** | Testing many strategies and picking best performer | Test a PRIOR hypothesis |
| Look-ahead Bias | Using info not available at the time | Use point-in-time data |
| Survivorship Bias | Using only surviving companies | Include delisted/failed firms |

**Why This is Data Snooping:**
- Pirlo backtests **numerous strategies**
- Pirlo picks the strategy with **highest t-statistics**
- This is "cherry-picking" — making inference AFTER looking at results

**Data snooping = Testing many hypotheses and selecting the best result**

This inflates statistical significance because:
- With enough tests, SOME will show significance by chance
- Picking the "winner" doesn't mean it will work going forward

**Why B (Look-ahead) is Wrong:**
The vignette explicitly states Pirlo "uses point-in-time data while accounting for reporting lags and data revisions" — this AVOIDS look-ahead bias.

**Why C (Survivorship) is Wrong:**
The vignette states Pirlo uses "point-in-time data" which includes companies as they existed at each point — this AVOIDS survivorship bias.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Data snooping:** Bad research design (test many, pick best)
- **Look-ahead:** Using future information
- **Survivorship:** Using only survivors

## Quantitative Methods

### Q29 — Log-Linear Trend Prediction

**Full Vignette Context:**
Susan Branson is a quantitative analyst studying several financial and economic time series.

Branson fits a log-linear trend model to the monthly values of a financial variable (in $ thousands). The time series consists of 964 monthly observations, and the most recent observation of the time series is 4,860. Branson uses the estimated coefficients of the log-linear trend model in Exhibit 1 to predict the trend value of the variable for the following month.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Coefficient | Value | Standard Error |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Intercept | 2.5230 | 0.0195 |
| t (Trend) | 0.0068 | 0.0004 |

**Question:**
The predicted trend value of the financial variable for the following month is closest to:

A. 4,893
B. 8,822
C. 9,085

**Your Answer:** A (4,893)

**Correct Answer:** B (8,822)

**Full Explanation:**

**Log-Linear Trend Model:**
> ln(y_t) = b₀ + b₁ × t

To predict y, we need to:
1. Calculate ln(y) using the model
2. **Exponentiate** to get y

**Step 1: Identify the Next Period**
- Most recent observation is period 964
- Next month is period **t = 965**

**Step 2: Calculate ln(y₉₆₅)**
> ln(y₉₆₅) = 2.5230 + 0.0068 × 965
> ln(y₉₆₅) = 2.5230 + 6.562
> ln(y₉₆₅) = **9.085**

**Step 3: Exponentiate to Get y₉₆₅**
> y₉₆₅ = e^9.085
> y₉₆₅ = **8,821.97 ≈ 8,822**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer A = 4,893):**
You applied the growth rate to the LAST OBSERVED value instead of using the model:

Wrong method:
> Growth rate per month = e^0.0068 ≈ 1.00682 (about 0.68% per month)
> y₉₆₅ = 4,860 × 1.00682 = 4,893

This method ignores the model's intercept and cumulative trend.

**Why C is Wrong (9,085):**
Answer C forgets to exponentiate — it's the ln(y) value, not y itself.

**Key Steps for Log-Linear Models:**
1. Use model to calculate **ln(y)**
2. **Exponentiate** (e^...) to convert back to y
3. Never just apply growth rate to last observation

### Q30 — Dickey-Fuller Test Interpretation

**Full Vignette Context:**
Branson also analyzes the quarterly time series of another financial variable. She performs a Dickey–Fuller test on the time series and fails to reject the null hypothesis of the test at the chosen significance level.

**Question:**
The test performed by Branson indicates that the quarterly financial time series:

A. Has a unit root
B. Is covariance stationary
C. Exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity

**Your Answer:** B (Is covariance stationary)

**Correct Answer:** A (Has a unit root)

**Full Explanation:**

**Dickey-Fuller Test Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The time series HAS a unit root (non-stationary)
- **H₁ (Alternative):** The time series does NOT have a unit root (stationary)

**Branson's Result:**
- She **FAILS TO REJECT** the null hypothesis
- Therefore, she cannot reject that the series has a unit root
- Conclusion: **The series HAS a unit root**

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
You reversed the null and alternative hypotheses. Failing to reject H₀ means accepting that there IS a unit root, not that the series is stationary.

| Test Result | Conclusion |
|-------------|------------|
| Reject H₀ | No unit root → Stationary |
| **Fail to reject H₀** | **Has unit root → Non-stationary** |

**Why B is Wrong:**
Covariance stationarity requires NO unit root. Branson failed to reject the unit root hypothesis, so the series is NOT covariance stationary.

**Why C is Wrong:**
The Dickey-Fuller test is for unit roots, NOT for ARCH effects. Use the Engle test for ARCH.

**Key Point:**
> Dickey-Fuller: H₀ = Unit root exists (non-stationary)
> Fail to reject → Unit root → Non-stationary

### Q32 — F1 Score Calculation

**Full Vignette Context:**
Branson evaluates the machine-learning model's performance using the information in Exhibit 2. She calculates the F1 score to evaluate the overall performance of the model.

**Exhibit 2 — Confusion Matrix:**
|  | Actual: Up (Class "1") | Actual: Down (Class "0") |
|--|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Predicted: Up (Class "1")** | 350 | 533 |
| **Predicted: Down (Class "0")** | 246 | 941 |

**Question:**
The F1 score for the machine-learning model is closest to:

A. 0.47
B. 0.59
C. 0.62

**Your Answer:** C (0.62)

**Correct Answer:** A (0.47)

**Full Explanation:**

**Step 1: Extract Confusion Matrix Values**
- TP (True Positive) = 350
- FP (False Positive) = 533
- FN (False Negative) = 246
- TN (True Negative) = 941

**Step 2: Calculate Precision**
> Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
> Precision = 350 / (350 + 533)
> Precision = 350 / 883
> Precision = **0.3964**

**Step 3: Calculate Recall**
> Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
> Recall = 350 / (350 + 246)
> Recall = 350 / 596
> Recall = **0.5872**

**Step 4: Calculate F1 Score**
> F1 = (2 × Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
> F1 = (2 × 0.3964 × 0.5872) / (0.3964 + 0.5872)
> F1 = 0.4655 / 0.9836
> F1 = **0.4733 ≈ 0.47**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer C = 0.62):**
You calculated **ACCURACY** instead of F1 Score:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total
> = (350 + 941) / (350 + 533 + 246 + 941)
> = 1,291 / 2,070
> = **0.6237 ≈ 0.62**

**Why B is Wrong (0.59):**
Answer B is **RECALL** alone, not F1:
> Recall = 350 / 596 = 0.587 ≈ 0.59

**Key Formulas:**

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Precision | TP / (TP + FP) |
| Recall | TP / (TP + FN) |
| **F1 Score** | **(2 × P × R) / (P + R)** |
| Accuracy | (TP + TN) / Total |

**Memory Aid:**
> F1 is the HARMONIC MEAN of Precision and Recall
> F1 balances both metrics — useful when classes are imbalanced

### Q41 — REOC vs REIT vs Direct Investment Selection

**Full Vignette Context:**
Alix Montana, an investment consultant, advises family offices and institutional clients on real estate investments.

**D'Amato Family:**
The D'Amato family plans to add real estate to their portfolio. They tell Montana that their requirements for the investment are:
1. **High liquidity**
2. **Maximization of growth opportunities**

To meet these requirements, Montana considers three investment vehicles: a public real estate operating company (REOC), an equity REIT, and a direct investment in an income-producing property.

**Question:**
Based on the D'Amato family's requirements, which of the following real estate investment vehicles is the most suitable to add to their portfolio?

A. REOC
B. Equity REIT
C. Direct investment in an income-producing property

**Your Answer:** B (Equity REIT)

**Correct Answer:** A (REOC)

**Full Explanation:**

**Evaluate Each Requirement:**

**Requirement 1: High Liquidity**

| Vehicle | Liquidity | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **REOC** | **HIGH** | Publicly traded |
| **REIT** | **HIGH** | Publicly traded |
| Direct | LOW | Illiquid, long sale process |

Both REOC and REIT satisfy the liquidity requirement. Direct investment does NOT.

**Requirement 2: Maximum Growth Opportunities**

| Vehicle | Growth Potential | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **REOC** | **HIGH** | No distribution requirement; can reinvest all earnings |
| REIT | LIMITED | Must distribute 90%+ of taxable income |
| **Direct** | **HIGH** | Full control over reinvestment |

REOCs can reinvest earnings freely into development, acquisitions, and trading real estate. REITs are constrained by mandatory distribution requirements.

**Combined Analysis:**

| Vehicle | Liquidity | Growth | Meets Both? |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **REOC** | ✓ | ✓ | **YES** |
| REIT | ✓ | ✗ | NO |
| Direct | ✗ | ✓ | NO |

**Only REOC meets BOTH requirements.**

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
REITs have high liquidity but LIMITED growth opportunities due to the 90%+ distribution requirement. They cannot retain earnings for reinvestment like REOCs can.

**Key REIT Constraint:**
> REITs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income as dividends
> This limits their ability to reinvest for growth

### Q43 — REIT NAV Per Share Calculation

**Full Vignette Context:**
The management of Slade considers investing in a multi-family REIT. Montana values the REIT using the financial information (in $ millions) in Exhibit 1. Montana forecasts an annual net operating income (NOI) growth rate of 3% and uses a capitalization rate of 5%. The REIT has 20 million shares outstanding.

**Exhibit 1:**
| Item | Value ($ millions) |
|------|-------------------|
| NOI for the last 12 months | 80 |
| Cash and equivalents | 12 |
| Land held for future development | 32 |
| Total debt and other liabilities | 192 |

**Question:**
The NAV per share for the multi-family REIT is closest to:

A. $72.80
B. $75.00
C. $84.60

**Your Answer:** A ($72.80)

**Correct Answer:** B ($75.00)

**Full Explanation:**

**REIT NAV Calculation Steps:**

**Step 1: Calculate Next 12 Months NOI**
> Next NOI = Current NOI × (1 + g)
> Next NOI = $80M × (1 + 0.03)
> Next NOI = $80M × 1.03
> Next NOI = **$82.4 million**

**Step 2: Estimate Value of Operating Real Estate**
> Operating RE Value = Next NOI / Cap Rate
> Operating RE Value = $82.4M / 0.05
> Operating RE Value = **$1,648 million**

**Step 3: Calculate Gross Asset Value**
> Gross Asset Value = Operating RE + Cash + Land
> Gross Asset Value = $1,648M + $12M + $32M
> Gross Asset Value = **$1,692 million**

**Step 4: Calculate Net Asset Value**
> NAV = Gross Asset Value − Debt and Liabilities
> NAV = $1,692M − $192M
> NAV = **$1,500 million**

**Step 5: Calculate NAV Per Share**
> NAVPS = NAV / Shares Outstanding
> NAVPS = $1,500M / 20M shares
> NAVPS = **$75.00**

**Why You Got It Wrong (Answer A = $72.80):**
You did NOT add cash and land held for development to the gross asset value:

Wrong calculation:
> Gross Asset Value = $1,648M (operating RE only)
> NAV = $1,648M − $192M = $1,456M
> NAVPS = $1,456M / 20M = $72.80

**Why C is Wrong ($84.60):**
Answer C forgets to subtract debt and liabilities:
> NAVPS = $1,692M / 20M = $84.60

**NAV Formula:**
> NAV = (Operating RE + Cash + Land + Other Assets) − (Debt + Liabilities)

**Key Components to Include:**
- ✓ Capitalized NOI for operating properties
- ✓ Cash and equivalents
- ✓ Land held for development
- ✓ Subtract ALL debt and liabilities

## Key Concepts to Remember

**Model Selection:**
- FCFE = Control perspective
- Residual Income = Negative FCF situations

**Comparable Transactions:**
- Calculate multiples for EACH comp first
- THEN average the multiples

**Dickey-Fuller Test:**
- H₀: Unit root EXISTS (non-stationary)
- Fail to reject = Has unit root

**Bond Classification (IFRS):**
- FVPL: Both interest AND FV changes hit P&L
- FVOCI: FV changes go to OCI, not P&L

**Forward Contract Value:**
- Lower future rates than expected → Long forward gains

**REOC vs REIT:**
- REOC: Can reinvest all earnings → More growth
- REIT: Must distribute 90%+ → Limited growth
